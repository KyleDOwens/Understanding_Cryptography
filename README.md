This repository contains implementations of cryptographic scheme/primitives. They follow the logic outlined in the textbook "Understanding Cryptography" by Christof Paar, Jan Pelzl, and Tim Güneysu.

These implementations are **NOT** written to be used as a tool, nor are they secure, nor are they efficient. These implementations should not be used for any reason. These are only to help me learn, take notes, and gain a deeper unstanding of the material.
