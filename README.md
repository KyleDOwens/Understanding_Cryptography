This repository contains the exercises and cryptographic scheme implementations from the textbook "Understanding Cryptography" by Christof Paar's, Jan Pelzl's, and Tim Güneysu.

These implementations are **NOT** written with the user in mind, nor are they secure, nor are they effecient. These implementations should not be used for any reason, they are only to help me learn and gain a deeper unstanding of the material. 

Schemes implemented:
```

    ├── chacha20.c
    ├── salsa20.c
    └── trivium.c
